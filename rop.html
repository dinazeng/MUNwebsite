		<h2>The Flow of a MUN Committee</h2>

MUN follows a special rules of procedure, which are the guidelines that decide when and how delegates are allowed to talk. Without the standards of the rules of procedure, MUN conferences would simply transform into loud arguments, which would generally not produce meaningful progression.
<br><br>
<h3>Points and Rights</h3>
Points and rights hold precedence over motions, and shall be outlined on the back of each delegate’s placard as follows:
<ul>
<li>Point of Personal Privilege
If delegates are at personal discomfort, they may raise a point of personal privilege. </li>
<li>
Point of Inquiry
A delegate may present this point should they need clarification on a certain matter.
</li><li>
Point of Order
A delegate may present this point if they detect an error in the execution of the Rules of Procedure.
</li><li>
Right of Reply
If a delegate’s personal or national integrity is challenged, they may send a note requesting for a right of reply.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Yields</h3>
After having completed their speeches on the Secondary Speakers list, delegates are obliged to yield the remainder of their time to:
<ul>
<li>
The Dais
Being the most common yield, this allows the delegate to retire and the next delegate on the Speakers List shall be called upon.
</li><li>
Another Delegate
Used as a strategic move, delegates may appoint the remainder of their speaking time to another delegate to further their point, should they accept.
</li><li>
Questions/Comments
The committee may use the remainder of the speakers time to comment or question the content of the delegate’s speech.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roll Call:</h3>
At the beginning of each committee session, the chair will conduct Roll Call, which is essentially a check of attendance, marking the official opening of the committee session. The chair will call for each delegation in alphabetical order, and as delegates are called upon, they must raise their placard, as they respond. Delegates may either respond “present” or “present and voting,” the only difference being that delegates responding “present and voting” may not abstain on a substantive vote.

<h3>Motion to Open Debate</h3>
After roll call, the dais will call for any motions on the floor, expecting for a motion to open debate. The dais will call upon a delegate with their raised placard, who will then say, “The delegate of _________ motions to open debate.” This will then be passed through a simple majority.

<h3>Secondary Speakers List</h3>
The committee will then move onto opening the secondary speakers list, through a motion. The chair will call upon those wishing to be added onto the secondary speakers lisht, after which those delegates deliver a two minute speech on the topic and the direction they wish to see in the committee’s discussion. During this speech, delegates must not go into details, or solutions, as this is a period to present broader ideas. When finished speaking, delegates must yield their time (refer to Yields). During debate, a delegate may request to be added to the speaker’s list by sending a note to the dais. The Secondary Speakers list is then followed by a moderated caucus.

<h3>Moderated Caucus</h3>
Moderated Caucuses are periods of moderated discussion/debate, used to break down a broader concept to focus on specific aspects. Delegates must motion for a moderated caucus, specifying the topic, overall period, and individual speaking time. “The delegation of _______ motions for a 10 (total time) to 1 (individual speaking time) moderated caucus to discuss ________.” Several may be presented, however one is chosen through a simple majority vote.

<h3>Unmoderated Caucus</h3>
Unmoderated Caucuses are usually granted towards the end of the first committee session or onwards. As the name suggests, it is a time when the delegates are not bound by ROP and are free to leave their seats and interact freely, enabling an exchange of ideas otherwise not possible through formal debate. This time is usually for forming blocs, collecting signatories and writing working papers and draft resolutions.

<h3>Roundtables:</h3>
During roundtables, the dais will call upon every delegate to share their view on a decided topic, with no longer than one minute speaking time per delegate. While time consuming, roundtables ensure that every delegate’s perspective is declared to the committee.

<h3>The Presentation of Working Papers</h3>
By the middle of the second committee session, delegates will have substantial debate to guide them in formulating a cluster of ideas, which is essentially a rough collection of potential solutions. Upon being reviewed by the dais shall, the cluster of ideas shall be a working paper, and once introduced to the committee, it shall officially become a draft resolution.

<h3>Hosting a Questions and Answers Period</h3>
After presenting a Working Paper, the committee may request the sponsors to host a Q&A session through a motion. Depending on the clarification needed, Q&A sessions may be 5, 10 or 15 minutes long, and only one sponsor may address a given question.

<h3>Amendments</h3>
After the presentation of a working paper, delegates may wish to request for a specific alteration, which they shall enact upon by presenting an amendment. Amendments are to be formatted as an operative clause in a resolution paper, and come in two different flavours: friendly (favoured by the sponsors) and unfriendly (rejected by the sponsors). Friendly amendments can just be submitted to the Dais with the sponsor’s written approval, however unfriendly amendments must be submitted to the dais with 20% of the committee present as signatories and shall then be voted upon by the committee.

<h3>Entering Voting Procedure</h3>
Once all Working Papers have been presented and finalized, the committee shall enter Voting Procedure through a motion to Table Debate. When passed, the doors of the committee must be “barred” and no one can enter or leave the room. Delegates shall then decide on the order of Draft Resolution presentation, as well as the method of voting.

<h3>Methods of Voting</h3>

Vote by Placard
Voting by placard is the most common form of voting as it is the most efficient. The chair will call for all those in favor of passing the Draft Resolution to raise their placards, with a two-thirds majority required for Resolution to be passed.

Vote by Roll Call
The chair will call upon each delegate, who may respond with “yes,” “no,” “abstain,” or “yes/no with rights.” Only delegates who declared “present” during roll call may choose to abstain, and delegates who respond “yes/no with rights” are allowed a one-minute justification after the voting is done.

Vote by Acclamation
The chair will call for any objections; if there are none, the resolution is automatically passed, however if there is an objection the committee must revert to an alternate form of voting.

Division of the Question and Clause by Clause
Voting Clause by Clause allows for delegates to vote on a single operative clause, whereas Division of the Question allows for the committee to vote on a select group of clauses separately from other clauses, only applicable to complete operative clauses.
