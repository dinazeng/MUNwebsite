		<h3>Featured Delegate: Dina Zeng</h3>
		<p>Hi! My name is Dina Zeng and in 2015, an upper year student introduced me to Model UN, and like many others, I was inspired from day one.
		After my first experience at TOLMUN 2016, I stayed involved in my school’s club at Johnston Heights – a small club of approximately 20 students. At first, I started off with delegating at club meetings and some day conferences where I would debate and discuss world issues with fellow delegates who each represented a nation.
		In grade 8 and 9, I often chose to represent Canada because that was what I was most familiar with. As I improved in public speaking, critical thinking, and acting as both a leader and diplomat, I began to explore other nations and researched into their beliefs.

		 <h3>Featured Conference: PRMUN 2020</h3>
		 <p> Panorama Ridge Model United Nations is one of the most unique and innovative day conferences in Canada. Located in Surrey, it has proven to be one of the fastest growing conferences of the Lower Mainland. With 5 committees, 15 staff
		 members, 9 secretariat members, and over 100 delegates attending. PRMUN 2020 is also passionate about keeping MUN accessible which is why they have received a sponsorship from the Canadian 
		 goverment to reduce all fees for all delegates. Meaning, all delegates can attend the conference, eat some good food, meet new friends, and experience the beauty that is Model United Nations
		 all free of charge! PRMUN 2020 is truly one of the best day conferences in Canada.<div class = "nope"><i>Click on the image to see PRMUN 2020's closing video!!</i></div></p>
