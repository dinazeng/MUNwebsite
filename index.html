		<p> Dear delegates, teachers, staff, and parents, <br><br>
My name is Dina Zeng and I am a former MUN delegate, staff member, and secretariat.
I first started MUN in grade 8 and I quickly became engrossed in the wonders of MUN.
 Like many others, I began my journey in MUN gavel hunting.
 When I got my first gavel less than a year later, I lost a lot of my passion for delegating, instead I moved onto staffing and organizing MUN conferences as a secretariat member.
 However, I was in grade 11 when I realized how much of a stress reliver and creative outlet MUN was for me in grade 8 and 9; I enjoyed discussing about politics and world issues, something not many of my peers at school like to do. 
 In short, I am still in MUN for the friends that I made in MUN. 
Looking back, I think MUN was a great experience and it has taught me many valuable lessons, especially with public speaking and critical thinking.
 All in all, I hope that MUN will be worthwhile just like it was for me and that you eventually grow to enjoy most if not all of the experiences that MUN can bring you. 

<br><br>I wish you all the best of luck in your Model United Nations journey. <br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
Dina Zeng
