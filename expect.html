		<h2>Your First MUN Conference...</h2>
		<p>You walk in the halls of the conference, delegates everywhere, scrambling to find their committees, you are lost, confused, frankly quite anxious and your friends are nowhere to be found. What now?
		Don't worry. Everyone was once in your shoes. That feeling of nervousness is hard to forget, even for a veteran delegate.</p>
		<p>The moment opening ceremonies start, you may feel a change in the atmosphere. Suddenly, it feels a lot more formal and everyone is focused on what the key note speaker or the secretariat team are saying.
		Next thing you know, you are thrust into your committee and first committee session begins. Every single delegate is eager to speak, placards are raised, the gavel gets banged, and you are left to fend for yourself, 
		piecing together idea after idea, speech after speech.</p>
		<h3>What to Expect</h3>
		<p>Each committee will vary in pacing but generally, they move quickly. The first few committee sessions will mostly be moderated caucuses and speeches and the later sessions will consist of resolution paper writings, unmods, and presentations.
		You will be buried in a ton of notes and ideas however, if you stay organized, this will not be a problem. Every delegate will bring a new flavor to the table and you will be inspired by the veteran delegates or the talented beginner delegates. At the end of the day, 
		you will have learned new skills, developed a deeper understanding of your topic, and made some good friends. </p>
		<h3>How to Prepare</h3>
		<p>There are many in which you can prepare for the conference. Whether that is researching your topic, preplaning your speeches, or even talking to a mirror
		in order to boost your public speaking skills. All of these examples are vital to your success in the committee and growth as a delegate. There is no single
		way to learn how to MUN however, a good foundation to start would be researching and practicing towards your success. A good way to start learn your Rules of Procedure! <a href ="rop.html">Click here to read more about ROP</a>
		But remember, keep things interesting and fun throughout your journey in MUN. You can do that by listening to some good music!

	<h3>During the Conference</h3>
	<p>While MUN is all about diplomacy, it is still a competition. Each delegate will be striving to do their very best and win the gavel. The dais will try to include all delegates and aid any beginner delegates as much as they can.
		If you have any questions, your best bet would to be to ask them for help; tip: ask your director for help with ideas (content for speeches and resolution papers) and your chair or AD for help with ROP and speeches.
		It will take time for you to develop your abilities as a delegate, this is normal.
		What you can do is to jot down notes, speak as much as you can, form a bloc, talk to other delegates during breaks and unmods, and participate with the resolution paper. Over time your speeches will improve but only
		if you raise your placard.Sometimes the debate dies down and the committee becomes quite slow. Take this opportunity to let yourself be known, this will make your dias remember you.</p>
		<p>Consider this: in order to stand out within the crowd of delegates, you must showcase your abilities. Find what suits you best, whether that is inserting bad puns or 
		adding some well thought-out ideas into the resolution paper, the goal at the end of the day is to display your diplomatic and leadership skills. This means that you must
		practice practice practice! Write your first speeches out, whisper it to yourself, work on your expressions in front of a mirror. The more you do it, the better you will get.
		Eventually, you will be able to make a speech without preparation, all it takes is practice.</p>
