		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p> Staffing? Delegating? What do they mean? Who are the Secretariat? Is it a team of secretaries? Close. But not quite. The secretariat team is the team
		of organizers who have carefully planned and hosted the conference. You, a delegate, are a particiapant of the conference with a group of people that are in 
		your committee. The Staff team will be your dias members and they will be moderating debate and guiding you through your discussion.<br><br>

		<h3>Career Ideas</h3>
		<p>As a first-time delegate, you may not know why it will benefit you to join the Model United Nations community. It can be quite stressful and we are 
		rumored to be for hardcore debators. But, worry not. MUN has a place for everyone, as long as your willing to speak up and let your voice be heard. MUN
		is also quite beneficial for your future too. Through MUN you can learn public speaking, debate, improve your critical thinking skills, boost your resume, and much more!
		<br><br>
		 <h3>MUN Positions</h3>
		 <p> There are 3 types of positions that you need to know about: the secretariat, the staff, and you the delegate. Like I said above, the secretariat team is 
		 the team that prepares the conference for you. They organize everything that you see: the venue, the opening ceremonies, the debate topics, the committees, and even
		 the staff team. They are a team of truly well refined individuls who truly have a passion for MUN. The staff team are your dais members. Usually there are 3 staff members in each
		 committee: the director, the chair, and the assistant director. All of them work together to create the perfect MUN environment for you.
